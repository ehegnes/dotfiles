Glorious Dotfiles
==================

Anybody using symbolic links with a script to upload their dotfiles is doing it
wrong.

Use hardlinks -- they don't get enough love.  :(

People who need to link against files on a separate partition, you have no
excuse. You've been able to do `mount --bind` since Linux 2.4.0.
